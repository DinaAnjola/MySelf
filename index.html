    <h1>Myself</h1>
    <h2>Brief Description Of Myself</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generally</li><p> Generally, my name is 
            Dina Anjolaoluwa Afolashade. I'm 18 years
            old. I'm a student of Caleb University
            and I'm enrolled in the Computer science,
            Mathematics and Statistics program.
        </p>
        <li>Physically</li><p>Physically, if someone 
            was to look at me, they'd see a 5"2 
            dark-skinned lady. Although some would 
            argue that i'm short at 5"2, i like 
            to think of myself more as average height.
            I am not short.
            
        </p>
        <p>Height aside, they'd probably see a very
            slim girl; petite, fun-sized, thin,
            skinny, ive heard it all. What word would
            be used specifically depends on the 
            observer.
        </p><p>
            Other distinguishing features would be
            very dark hair, full brows, somewhat large
            eyes? I dont know, small nose...(or so im told),
            full lips(very full, i know cause i was
            bullied for it), small hands, small feet.
            i think thats all, i dont know, i cant see 
            myself as others see me.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Likes And Dislikes</h3>
    <p>What do i like? I love cooking. Love writing,
        love reading, love my mama, love people watching,
        love learning, listening, love cooking, baking,
        i enjoy watching tiktok videos, did i mention 
        i love cooking?
    </p><p>Oh yeah, my favourite food changes with 
        wind. But generally, i love dodo, moimoi,
        anything that efo-riro is involved in, And
        everything that has chicken and turkey involved.
    </p><h4>DISLIKES</h4><ul><li>Being stared at.

    </li></ul><p>Being stared at is just so weird,
        fels like theyre looking into your soul and 
        know your every secret. Well it actually 
        depends on who's staring (wink wink).
    </p><ul>
        <li>Um</li>
    </ul><p>Pictures. I despise pictures. </p><ul>
        <li>Other things</li>
    </ul><p> Other things i dont like; crowds,
        public speeches or anything like that,
        generally being asked to do anything in public;
        like dance or something(i would quite literally die.)
        I just dont like things normal people dont like,
        like loud chewing or putting dirty feet on walls,
        or someone intruding in my personal space. Not 
        a fan of social functions cus yeah crowds.
    </p>
    <h2>Where Do I See Myself In Five Years?</h2><p>
        I see myself studying. Getting a master's degree
        and of course, using any and every skill I've
        acquired to work on the side. In five years, I 
        have businesses( that i wont be mentioning right
        now for dramatic effect, seeing as these are 
        already in motion.) What precisely my degree 
        will be, i dont know yet. i'm taking my time in
        deciding. Might be AI or VR programming or air traffic
        controlling or data science... not sure yet.
